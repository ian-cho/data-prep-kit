## Project Overview

This project focuses on automating the integration of Large Language Models (LLM) based workflow in the data access.
It contains the following notebooks:

- [Planning_DPK_agent.ipynb](Planning_DPK_agent.ipynb): Planner for Data-Prep-Kit tasks with code generation. This notebook enables the data engineer (or data user) to efficiently build and run pipelines that performs required tasks defined by a natural language. It includes a langgraph LLM agent that has several components like planner, judge, and code generator. This agent can generate as a result a python code of a DPK pipeline which can be run by the user from command line.

- [dpk_as_tools.ipynb](dpk_as_tools.ipynb): Use DPK transforms defined as [langchain tools](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/tools/) or  [llama-index tools](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/agents/tools/). 
This notebook leverages LLM to generate a DPK transforms pipeline based on natural language inputs. 
The LLM processes the provided input and produces the pipeline in the correct format, making it ready for execution.
Subsequently, each transform in the pipeline is invoked by calling its lang-chain or llama-index implementations.


## Before you begin

Ensure that you have python 3.11

## Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:IBM/data-prep-kit.git
cd examples/agentic
```

2. Create Python virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter
pip install ipython && pip install ipykernel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure access to LLM:

   We have currently used the following frameworks:
   - [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) 
   - [Watsonx](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx)
   - locally running [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (on mac)

   Please note that the notebooks have been tested with a specific LLM and due to the inherent nature of LLMs, using a different model may not produce the same results.

   3.1 Setup Instructions for each framework:

   The notebook cell that defines the models contains all frameworks with only the replicate part uncomment.  To use one of the other frameworks uncomment its part in the cell while commenting out the other frameworks. 

   - Replicate:
      - Obtain Replicate API token
      - Store the following value in the `.env` file located in your project directory:
         ```
            REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your Replicate API token>
         ```
   - Ollama: 
      - Download [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download).
      - Download one of the supported [models](https://ollama.com/search).
      - update the `model_ollama_*` names in the relevant cells.
   - Watsonx:
      - Register for Watsonx
      - Obtain its API key
      - Store the following values in the `.env` file located in your project directory:
         ```
            WATSONX_URL=<WatsonX entry point, e.g. https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com>
            WATSON_PROJECT_ID=<your Watsonx project ID>
            WATSONX_APIKEY=<your Watsonx API key>
         ```

## Usage

To launch the notebooks, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
Jupyter notebook
```

Once the Jupyter interface is loaded, select the desired notebook to begin working with it.
