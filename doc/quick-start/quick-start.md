# Quick Start for Data Prep Kit 
Here we provided short examples of various uses of the Data Prep Kit. Most users who want to jump right in can use standard pip install to deploy the data-prep-kit and the python or ray transforms to their virtual python environment. 

When setting up a __virtual environment__ it is recommended to use __python3.11__ as in the example below using conda. 

## Create a Virtual Environment <a name = "conda"></a>
**setup a virtual environment using conda**

```shell
conda create -n data-prep-kit-1 -y python=3.11
```

**Linux system only: Install the gcc/g++ that is required while building fastext:**
If you are using a linux system, install gcc using the below commands, as it will be required to compile and install [fasttext](https://fasttext.cc/) currently used by some of the transforms.


```shell
conda install gcc_linux-64
conda install gxx_linux-64
```

**activate the new conda environment**

```shell
conda activate data-prep-kit-1
```

make sure env is switched to data-prep-kit-1 and Check python version.

```shell
python --version
The command above should say: 3.11
```

**install data prep toolkit**

```shell
pip3 install 'data-prep-toolkit-transforms[ray,all]'
```
the command above install the complete library with all the tansforms. In certain situations, it may be desirable to install a specific transform with or without the ray runtime. In that case, the command can specify the name of the transform in the \[extra\] value such as:

To install the lang_id transform, use the following command:

```shell
pip3 install 'data-prep-toolit-tranforms[lang_id]' 
```

to install the lang_id transform with the ray runtime, use the following command:

```shell
pip3 install 'data-prep-toolit-tranforms[ray,lang_id]' 
```



## Setting up Jupyter lab for local experimentation with transform notebooks <a name = "jupyter"></a>

```bash
pip install jupyterlab ipykernel ipywidgets
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=data-prep-kit --display-name "dataprepkit"
```



## Running transforms 

* Notebooks
    * There is a [simple notebook](../../examples/notebooks/Run_your_first_transform_colab.ipynb) for running a single transform that can be run from either Google Colab or the local environment by downloading the file.  
    * In most indidividual transform folders, we have included one (Python), two (Python and Ray), or three (Python, Ray and Spark) notebooks for running that transform. In order to run all these notebooks in the local environment, we clone the repo as: 
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:IBM/data-prep-kit.git 
    ```
    Then we go to an indvidual transformer folder, where we find the corresponding notebooks. As an example:

    ```bash
    cd data-prep-kit/transforms/universal/fdedup
    make venv
    source venv/bin/activate 
    pip install jupyterlab
    jupyter lab
    ```
    You can now run the [Python version](../../transforms/universal/fdedup/fdedup_python.ipynb), [Ray version](../../transforms/universal/fdedup/fdedup_ray.ipynb) or [Spark version](../../transforms/universal/fdedup/fdedup_spark.ipynb) of the three notebooks for this transform. 


* Command line  
    * [Using a docker image](run-transform-image.md) - runs a transform in a docker transform image 
    * [Using a virtual environment](run-transform-venv.md) - runs a transform on the local host 

## Running transforms on Windows

The following transforms have been shown to work on Windows with the patched release described below:

    pdf2parquet
    doc_chunk
    doc_quality
    html2parqet
    pii_redactor
    text_encoder
    doc_id
    ededup
    filter
    hap
    profiler
    resize
    tokenization


A working windows environment can be setup using Anaconda Navigator with:
* Python 3.12.7
* Windows-11-10.0.22631-SP0
* 3.12.7 | packaged by Anaconda, Inc. | (main, Oct 4 2024, 13:17:27) [MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64)]

To install the transforms on windows, use the following commands:

```
pip intall data-prep-toolkit==0.2.3.post1
pip install data-prep-toolkit-transforms[all]
pip install fasttext-wheel
```

To install the ray transforms on windows using the ray runtime, use the following commands:

```
pip intall data-prep-toolkit[ray]==0.2.3.post1
pip install data-prep-toolkit-transforms[all]
pip install fasttext-wheel
```

To install a single transform, for example pdf2parquet, use the following commands:
```bash
pip intall data-prep-toolkit==0.2.3.post1
pip install --user data-prep-toolkit-transforms[pdf2parquet]
```

If you want to try Notebooks that run many of the transforms in sequence, use the Anaconda Navigator to install and launch an instance of Jupyter Notebook and use the following sample [Notebook](../../transforms/transforms-1.0-lang-Windows.ipynb) for the python runtime and another sample [Notebook for the ray](../../transforms/transforms-1.0-lang-ray-Windows.ipynb) runtime. 
    
## Creating transforms

* [Tutorial](contribute-your-own-transform.md) - shows how to use the library to add a new transform.
