# Pdf2Parquet Transform 

The Pdf2Parquet transform iterates through PDF, Docx, Pptx, Images files or zip of files and generates parquet files
containing the converted document in Markdown or JSON format.

The conversion is using the [Docling package](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling).

Please see the set of
[transform project conventions](../../README.md#transform-project-conventions)
for details on general project conventions, transform configuration,
testing and IDE set up.

## Input files

This transform supports the following input formats:

- PDF documents
- DOCX documents
- PPTX presentations
- Image files (png, jpeg, etc)
- HTML pages
- Markdown documents
- ASCII Docs documents

The input documents can be provided in a folder structure, or as a zip archive.
Please see the configuration section for specifying the input files.


## Output format

The output table will contain following columns

| output column name | data type | description |
|-|-|-|
| source_filename | string | the basename of the source archive or file |
| filename | string | the basename of the PDF file |
| contents | string | the content of the PDF |
| document_id | string | the document id, a random uuid4  |
| document_hash | string | the document hash of the input content |
| ext | string | the detected file extension |
| hash | string | the hash of the `contents` column |
| size | string | the size of `contents` |
| date_acquired | date | the date when the transform was executing |
| num_pages | number | number of pages in the PDF |
| num_tables | number | number of tables in the PDF |
| num_doc_elements | number | number of document elements in the PDF |
| pdf_convert_time | float | time taken to convert the document in seconds |


## Configuration

The transform can be initialized with the following parameters.

| Parameter  | Default  | Description  |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| `data_files_to_use`          | - | The files extensions to be considered when running the transform. Example value `['.pdf','.docx','.pptx','.zip']`. For all the supported input formats, see the section above. |
| `batch_size`                 | -1 | Number of documents to be saved in the same result table. A value of -1 will generate one result file for each input file. |
| `artifacts_path`             | <unset> | Path where to Docling models artifacts are located, if unset they will be downloaded and fetched from the [HF_HUB_CACHE](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/manage-cache) folder. |
| `contents_type`         | `text/markdown`        | The output type for the `contents` column. Valid types are `text/markdown`, `text/plain` and `application/json`. |
| `do_table_structure`         | `True`        | If true, detected tables will be processed with the table structure model. |
| `do_ocr`                     | `True`        | If true, optical character recognition (OCR) will be used to read the content of bitmap parts of the document. |
| `ocr_engine`                 | `easyocr`     | The OCR engine to use. Valid values are `easyocr`, `tesseract`, `tesseract_cli`. |
| `bitmap_area_threshold`      | `0.05`        | Threshold for running OCR on bitmap figures embedded in document. The threshold is computed as the fraction of the area covered by the bitmap, compared to the whole page area. |
| `pdf_backend`                | `dlparse_v2`  | The PDF backend to use. Valid values are `dlparse_v2`, `dlparse_v1`, `pypdfium2`. |
| `double_precision`           | `8`           | If set, all floating points (e.g. bounding boxes) are rounded to this precision. For tests it is advised to use 0. |


Example

```py
{
    "data_files_to_use": ast.literal_eval("['.pdf','.docx','.pptx','.zip']"),
    "contents_type": "application/json",
    "do_ocr": True,
}
```


## Usage

### Launched Command Line Options 

When invoking the CLI, the parameters must be set as `--pdf2parquet_<name>`, e.g., `--pdf2parquet_do_ocr=true`.


### Running the samples
To run the samples, use the following `make` target

* `run-cli-sample` - runs dpk_pdf2parquet/transform_python.py using command line args

These targets will activate the virtual environment and set up any configuration needed.
Use the `-n` option of `make` to see the detail of what is done to run the sample.

For example, 
```shell
make run-cli-sample
...
```
Then 
```shell
ls output
```
To see results of the transform.


### Code example

See the [sample notebook](pdf2parquet.ipynb) for an example

### Transforming data using the transform image

To use the transform image to transform your data, please refer to the 
[running images quickstart](../../../doc/quick-start/run-transform-image.md),
substituting the name of this transform image and runtime as appropriate.

## Testing

Following [the testing strategy of data-processing-lib](../../../data-processing-lib/doc/transform-testing.md)

Currently we have:
- [Unit test](test/test_pdf2parquet_python.py)
- [Integration test](test/test_pdf2parquet.py)

# Pdf2parquet Ray Transform 

This module implements the ray version of the [pdf2parquet transform](dpk_pdf2parquet/ray/).

## Configuration and command line Options

Ingest PDF to Parquet configuration and command line options are the same as for the base python transform. 


## Running

### Launched Command Line Options 
When running the transform with the Ray launcher (i.e., TransformLauncher),
in addition to those available to the transform for the Python version in this file,
the set of 
[ray launcher](../../../data-processing-lib/doc/ray-launcher-options.md) are available.

### Transforming data using the transform image

To use the transform image to transform your data, please refer to the 
[running images quickstart](../../../doc/quick-start/run-transform-image.md),
substituting the name of this transform image and runtime as appropriate.


## Prometheus metrics

The transform will produce the following statsd metrics:

| metric name                      | Description                                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| worker_pdf_doc_count             | Number of PDF documents converted by the worker                  |
| worker_pdf_pages_count           | Number of PDF pages converted by the worker                      |
| worker_pdf_page_avg_convert_time | Average time for converting a single PDF page on each worker     |
| worker_pdf_convert_time          | Time spent converting a single document                          |
